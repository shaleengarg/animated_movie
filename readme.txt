Concept: The short animation shows how different tech companies have performed in the market, over the years.
	 It is the story of how Microsoft has had a lower share in the market over the last few years.
	 First, Android and then Apple has bludgeoned Microsoft with their technological prowess and creativity.
	 The video is a creative representation of these SmartPhone Wars, adding a humour quotient to the story.
	

Characters: Microsoft
	    Android
	    Apple
	    Audience (different company phones)


The story has been narrated to express how Microsoft was dominating the phone market before the 2000's where there was an exponential rise of smartphone users where Microsoft lagged behind and was eventually terminated from the game.

Objects used:

Football stadium: Depiciting a feel of competition and business game.
Audience: Inspired from movie: Cars where, cars are people, in our movie, phones are depicted as audience
Android: The android object is a fully functional object with movable parts
Apple logo: We have added fangs to the bite in apple showing it more scary. It also has powers of fireball which completely bashes windows
Windows logo: The simplest of them all, windows logo is made to personify the microsoft phone company.

Steps Followed in making the movie:

1. Choosing a plot: We took a look at the available templates in webgl and decided our plot on the basis of available templates. Then we took a drastic decision, make our own objects and then model the movie, this would give us the exposure of how animated movies are made.
2. Making the objects: We made the objects shown in the movie other than the stadium which was used as a template given the timeperiod for the assignment. We used a tool called blender to make the objects and then used .obj format to export it to three.js
3.Placing everything together: After making all the objects, we placed everything in the world, added movements in the code so as to make it flexible while making the movie if the plot changes. 
4. After extensively testing all the components of our code, we started rendering the movie part by part on a 8Gib memory, intel I7 processor. It was not an easy task but then it was done.
5. We used all the snippets we generated and used a tool to stitch all of them into one final product
